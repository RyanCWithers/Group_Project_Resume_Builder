Django-React Resume Builder
---------------------------

After further research, it may be better to set up a Django REST API and use a JavaScript
solution for the resumes, especially since we are not currently incorporating users and we
want to learn how to get Django and React to work together. PDFMake uses JavaScript, so it
should be compatible with React. For the backend, we would create Django models that have props
for React to pull in data.

PO:
- initial set up of the project
- routing and resume models
- setup of PDFMAKE
- Django settings for compatibility with React

P1:
- home page template 
- resume builder page template 
- 1-2 resume designs for download
- basic CSS styling

P2:
- page template that uses a job board API to display open jobs 

Future Features:
- Users and profiles
- Users can save resumes for future use and name them
- Users can delete resumes from their accounts
- Users can keep track of which jobs they applied to and which resumes they sent
- Refactoring the project into an API for use with any JS frontend
