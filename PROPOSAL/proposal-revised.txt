Django-React Resume Builder
---------------------------

After further research, it may be better to set up a Django REST API and use a JavaScript
solution for the resumes, especially since we are not currently incorporating users and we
want to learn how to get Django and React to work together.  We decided to go with a 
JavaScript PDF generator solution, so it should be compatible with React and the JSON data from the Django API. 

The Django REST API converts the model into JSON data which React can easily pull in. 

Basically, this will be a beta version of a Resume Builder app that does not have user profiles
at this time. 

PO:
- initial set up of the project (backend and frontend)
- routing and resume models 
- setup of JavaScript PDF generator solution 
- Django settings for compatibility with React 

P1:
- home page template 
- resume builder page template 
- 1-2 resume designs for download 
- CSS/SCSS styling 

P2:
- page template that uses a job board API to display open jobs  
- auto-delete Resume objects for app visitors - those not logged in as users 

Future Features:
- Job Listings Page (with Indeed API)
- Users and profiles
- Users can save resumes for future use and name them
- Users can delete resumes from their accounts
- Users can keep track of which jobs they applied to and which resumes they sent
- Refactoring the project into an API for use with any JS frontend

WHAT'S NEW TO US
----------------
- Django REST API and serializers
- Connecting Django and React together
- Incorporating an additional API into our API backend
