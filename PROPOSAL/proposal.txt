Django-React Resume Builder
---------------------------

There were several ways to approach this; however, since this is new to all of us, 
we wanted to get some basic practical experience. A more complicated way to do this project
would be to make Django a REST API backend with React handling the entire frontend. But since
we are also using a Django library to serve the resumes as PDF (and getting that working with Django
may be challenge enough), we decided to incorporate React as components into the project. 

PO:
- initial set up of the project
- routing and resume models
- setup of the ReportLab library 
- Django settings for compatibility with React

P1:
- home page template (almost all REACT components)
- resume builder page template (the form will connect to Django model but other design
around it could be REACT components)
- single resume template that the ReportLab library turns into a PDF
- basic CSS styling

P2:
- page template that uses a job board API to display open jobs 

Future Features:
- Users and profiles
- Users can save resumes for future use and name them
- Users can delete resumes from their accounts
- Users can keep track of which jobs they applied to and which resumes they sent
- Refactoring the project into an API for use with any JS frontend
